# RP-Chat-Commands
This is where all versions and updates to my RP chat commands for FiveM servers will be posted. 
# Installation
To install the RP Chat Commands, you will need to add the resource anywhere within the "recouces" folder in your server files. Then add RP-Chat-Commands to your "server.cfg" and start your server up and try them out. Good luck!!
